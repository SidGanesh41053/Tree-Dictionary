# Tree-Dictionary
Welcome to the Tree Dictionary Project, an innovative application leveraging a red-black tree data structure to create a dynamic dictionary and spell checker. This project was born out of a challenge to extend the capabilities of a standard red-black tree and tailor it to a unique, user-driven application. It is a versatile tool designed for efficient word searching, addition, and removal. At its core, it utilizes a red-black tree to manage a large dataset of words and their definitions. This structure not only guarantees optimal search times but also supports dynamic operations like insertion and deletion with automatic balancing.

Features
Word Search: Look up definitions of words stored in the dictionary.
Autocomplete: Suggest word completions based on partial inputs.
Data Management: Add or remove words, demonstrating the dynamic nature of the red-black tree.
Data Import: Load words and definitions from external CSV files.

Future Scope
Enhancements: Adding multi-word searches, storing multiple definitions, and including synonyms.
Simplifications: Potential removal of the autocomplete feature for streamlined functionality.

External Libraries and Tools
The project solely relies on the standard Java library.
